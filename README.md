Please check the [Laravel Official Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/master/installation) installation guide for server requirements before you start.

First, clone this repo

git clone https://github.com/alnahian2003/kleon.git
```

Switch to the repo folder

cd kleon
```

Install all the dependencies using composer and npm

npm install
```

Copy the `.env.example` file and make the required configuration changes in the .env file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Generate a new application key

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

Create an SQLite database. You can also use another database (MySQL, Postgres), simply update your configuration accordingly.

```bash
touch database/database.sqlite
```

Run the database migrations (Set the database connection in .env before migrating)

```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
```

Start the local development server

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Start Vite for bundling the assets or Hot Module Reload (required)

```bash
npm run dev
```

**You can now access the server at http://localhost:8000.**

### TL;DR

All the command list

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alnahian2003/kleon.git
```

```bash
cd kleon
```

```bash
composer install
```

```bash
npm install

```bash

```

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

```bash
touch database/database.sqlite
```

```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
```

```bash
php artisan serve
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Database Seeding (Optional)

Populate the database with seed data that includes relationships. This can help you to quickly get started and explore inside & out of this project.

Run the database seeder, and this will do it!

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

Note : It's recommended to have a clean database before seeding. You can refresh your migrations at any point to clean the database by running the following command

```bash
php artisan migrate:refresh
```
