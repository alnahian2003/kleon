# Kleon â€” Freelancer CRM

Kleon is a Laravel, Vue and InertiaJS powered Freelancer CRM. Here's my submission for [**Laravel Daily**](https://github.com/LaravelDaily/)'s [_Laravel Learning Roadmap_](https://github.com/LaravelDaily/Laravel-Roadmap-Learning-Path#advanced-beginner-level) Upper Beginner level challenge.

## Features

-   Login/Register as client, create and manage projects and tasks
-   Blazing fast experience, SPA like speed.
-   Free to use forever!

## Installation

Please check the [Laravel Official Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/master/installation) installation guide for server requirements before you start.

First, clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alnahian2003/kleon.git
```

Switch to the repo folder

```bash
cd kleon
```

Install all the dependencies using composer and npm

```bash
composer install
```

```bash
npm install
```

Copy the `.env.example` file and make the required configuration changes in the .env file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Generate a new application key

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

Create an SQLite database. You can also use another database (MySQL, Postgres), simply update your configuration accordingly.

```bash
touch database/database.sqlite
```

Run the database migrations (Set the database connection in .env before migrating)

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

Start the local development server

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Start Vite for bundling the assets or Hot Module Reload (required)

```bash
npm run dev
```

**You can now access the server at http://localhost:8000.**

### TL;DR

All the command list

```bash
git clone repoLink
```

```bash
cd repoName
```

```bash
composer install
```

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

```bash
touch database/database.sqlite
```

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

```bash
php artisan serve
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Database Seeding

Populate the database with seed data that includes relationships. This can help you to quickly get started and explore inside out of this project.

Run the database seeder, and this will do it!

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

Note : It's recommended to have a clean database before seeding. You can refresh your migrations at any point to clean the database by running the following command

```bash
php artisan migrate:refresh
```
